# Erdős #1162 — the number of subgroups of $S_n$, and their order

**Question.** Give an asymptotic formula for the number of subgroups of $S_n$.
Is there a statistical theorem on their order? (Erdős–Turán, [Va99, 5.73].)
**Status: open.** Not solved here.

## ELI5

Take $n$ numbered cards. A *shuffle* is any way of rearranging them, and $S_n$
is the collection of all of them — for 8 cards that is $8! = 40\,320$ shuffles.

Some sub-collections of shuffles are self-contained: do any two of them in a
row and you land on something still in the collection, and anything you do can
be undone without leaving it. Those are the **subgroups**. "Leave everything
alone" on its own is one. All 40 320 together is another. The interesting ones
sit in between — for instance, every shuffle that disturbs only the first three
cards and leaves the other five alone.

Erdős and Turán asked two questions about them.

**1. How many subgroups are there?** For 8 cards, exactly 151 221. For 18
cards it is about $7.6\times10^{18}$, so actually listing them is hopeless
well before you get there and the goal is a formula for roughly how big the
number is. This half is now largely answered by other people: it is about
$2^{n^2/16}$. For 100 cards that is a number with 189 digits.

**2. How big is a typical subgroup?** Pick one of those 151 221 at random. How
many shuffles does it contain? Erdős wanted a "statistical theorem" — a rule
for what to expect. This half is barely touched. One published theorem
addresses it, from 2025.

**What is in this repository.** Mostly work on question 2, in two rounds. The first counted one well-behaved family of subgroups exactly, out to 512 cards: its members are overwhelmingly concentrated at about $2^{n/4}$ shuffles, with a spread that stays bounded as $n$ grows. The second round proved that this family is a vanishing fraction of all subgroups, so it cannot be the answer. It then counted a larger family exactly, also out to 512 cards, whose typical member has about $2^{3n/8}$ shuffles; that limit is argued, not proved. Along the way it proved that there are at least about $2^{n^2/16}\,n^{7n/8}$ subgroups, up to a factor $2^{O(n)}$, which for large $n$ is more than the 2025 paper's lower bound. Whether that proof is new was checked against the 2025 paper only.

**The catch, and it is a real one.** The larger family is not known to be typical either. Nobody has proved that the subgroups outside it are rare, and at the sizes that can be checked directly, 6 to 18 cards, between 41.5 % and 59.4 % of all subgroups lie outside it and its companion family for odd $n$. For $4\le n\le8$ the average subgroup is nearer $2^{n/2}$ than $2^{3n/8}$. So $2^{3n/8}$ is a conjecture with some evidence behind it, not an answer, and the small-$n$ data are still drifting.

**Objective.** Fix the ambiguity in the displayed statement, compute exactly
— to $n=512$, far past any tabulated range — the rank-stratified family of
subgroups that carries the whole first-order answer, identify the limiting
constants in closed form, and turn the vague second half of the question into
a precise conjecture with the gap to the published theorem located exactly.
The full-lattice runs ($n\le8$) are a *validation* of the enumerator against
OEIS, not an extension: A005432 is already tabulated to $n=18$.

**Inputs.** The problem statement from [erdosproblems.com/1162](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1162); Roney-Dougal–Tracey, arXiv:2503.05416; OEIS A005432, A000638, A000085, A006116; the GroupNames table of transitive groups of degree up to 15, for the degree-8 groups of §9.1. Run `refs/fetch.sh` — nothing is redistributed here.

**Findings.**

* The logarithm in the displayed statement is **base 2** (§1) — the constant
  1/16 is meaningless otherwise, and the problem page never says so.
* The full subgroup lattice of $S_n$ recomputed for $n \le 8$ (151 221
  subgroups, 296 classes at $n=8$), matching A005432 and A000638 exactly.
* Elementary abelian 2-subgroups counted exactly to $n = 512$ — this family already carries the entire leading term $2^{n^2/16}$. Their rank concentrates at $n/4$ with a spread that does not grow: numerically the law tends to $\mathbb{P}(n/4+j) \propto 2^{-j^2}$, and the standard deviation of the exact rank distribution agrees with the closed form $0.849305961022908\ldots$ to **35 decimal places** at $n=512$. That is exact computation at each $n$, not a proof of the limit.
* A single maximal elementary abelian gives only $n^2/16 + 2.8820499654\ldots$
  — a *bounded* excess, with the constant $\log_2(\vartheta/\eta)$ in closed
  form. So the $n\log n$ gain in [RoTr25] Theorem 1 comes entirely from
  multiplicity.
* The second-order term of $\log_2 e(n)$, the elementary abelian count, is $\tfrac34 n\log_2 n$. It was derived from orbit structure (orbits of size 4 beat size 2 in a tie at the leading constant), confirmed by **out-of-sample** extrapolation ($A_\infty = 0.75057$), and is now proved up to $O(n)$ (Proposition 9.2).
* [RoTr25] Theorem 6 — the only published result on the *order* — has one lossy step, located exactly in §7: Lemma 2.4 is applied with $\ell \approx n$, where the maximal elementary abelian subgroups have rank $n/2$. With $n/2$ the threshold equation has **discriminant exactly zero** and a double root at $1/4$, and Conjecture 7.1 is that Theorem 6 holds for both of its constants up to $1/4$. The first version of this bullet said Theorem 6 *"is not optimal"*; §7 does not show that. The double root turned out to be automatic, under the assumptions of §9.9, for any family that reaches $2^{n^2/16}$, and the claim that $1/4$ is optimal for ν is withdrawn.
* **Theorem 9.1:** $\log_2 f(n) \ge n^2/16 + \tfrac78 n\log_2 n - O(n)$ (§9.4), by counting the Frattini-closed subgroups that induce a conjugate of the extraspecial group 8T22 $= 2^{1+4}_+$ on each of $n/8$ blocks of 8 points. It improves the large-$n$ constant: $\liminf_n (\log_2 f(n) - n^2/16)/(n\log_2 n) \ge 7/8$, where the explicit constant of the [RoTr25] proof is at most $5/906$. Theorem 1 of [RoTr25] is stated for all $n > 1$, where $n = 2$ caps the constant at $3/8$, so Theorem 9.1 does not let one put $7/8$ into it. Novelty was checked against [RoTr25] only, which singles out the same group in its upper-bound proof.
* **Proposition 9.2:** $e(n)/f(n) \le 2^{-\frac18 n\log_2 n + O(n)} \to 0$ (§9.5). The elementary abelian family of the bullets above is a vanishing fraction of all subgroups, so Conjecture 7.2, which put a typical subgroup at $2^{n/4}$, is withdrawn, not disproved.
* **A larger family,** the Frattini-closed 2-subgroups with every orbit of size at most 8, counted exactly for every $n \le 512$ (§9.1, §9.6). Inside it the mean of $\log_2|H|/n$ is 0.3835 at $n = 512$ and falling toward $3/8$, and the sd grows like $n^{1/4}$. The limits come from a saddle-point heuristic, not a proof.
* **Conjecture 9.3** replaces 7.2: $\log_2 f(n) = n^2/16 + \tfrac78 n\log_2 n + O(n)$, and a random subgroup has $\log_2|H| = (\tfrac38 + o(1))n$ in probability (§9.8). It rests on three unproved premises, which together say that the subgroups outside this family and its odd-$n$ companion $S_3(n)$ are negligible.

**Stated plainly:** the first family is proved atypical, and the second is not known to be typical. For $6 \le n \le 18$ roughly half of all subgroups lie outside it and its companion, the ratios of $f(n)$ to the formula the premises would give are still drifting, and for $4 \le n \le 8$ the mean of $\log_2|H|/n$ over all subgroups is between 0.47 and 0.51, above both $1/4$ and $3/8$. The asymptotic statements proved here are Theorem 9.1 and Propositions 9.2 and 9.4. The limit laws of both families, and the approximation $e(n) \approx G_{n/2}M(n)$ behind the first, rest on exact computation at each $n$ and on heuristic arguments, not on proofs.

Needs a Python 3 with numpy and mpmath (developed on 3.14.7), and poppler's `pdftotext` for the quotation checks; the header of `scripts/reproduce.sh` says which interpreter it picks and how `$PY` overrides it. The C enumerator needs a C99 compiler; it uses NEON intrinsics on arm64 and falls back to portable code elsewhere.
